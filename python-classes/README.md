## Description

This project is to understand what is Python and how use it, it was made in the software development program of [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.fr/).

## General

* What is OOP
* “first-class everything”
* What is a class
* What is an object and an instance
* What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
* What is an attribute
* What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
* What is ```self```
* What is a method
* What is the special ```__init__``` method and how to use it
* What is Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
* What is a property
* What is the difference between an attribute and a property in Python
* What is the Pythonic way to write getters and setters in Python
* How to dynamically create arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
* How to bind attributes to object and classes
* What is the ```__dict__``` of a class and/or instance of a class and what does it contain
* How does Python find the attributes of an object or class
* How to use the ```getattr``` function

## Requirements

* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using wc
* All your modules should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'```)
* All your classes should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'```)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'``` and ```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'```)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
