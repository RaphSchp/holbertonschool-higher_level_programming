## Description

This project is to understand what is Python and how use it, it was made in the software development program of [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.fr/).

## General

* Why Python programming is awesome
* What’s an interactive test
* Why tests are important
* How to write Docstrings to create tests
* How to write documentation for each module and function
* What are the basic option flags to create tests
* How to find edge cases

## Requirements

# Python Scripts

* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using ```wc```

# Python Test Cases

* Allowed editors: ```vvi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder ```tests```
* All your test files should be text files (extension: ```.txt```)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: ```python3 -m doctest ./tests/*```
* All your modules should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'```)
* All your functions should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'```)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
