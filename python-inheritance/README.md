## Description

This project is to understand what is Python and how use it, it was made in the software development program of [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.fr/).

## General

* What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
* What is a subclass
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When can an instance have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* What is the default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
* What is the purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use ```sinstance```, ```issubclass```, ```type``` and ```super``` built-in functions

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
* All your files should end with a new line
* The first line of all your files should be exactly ```#!/usr/bin/python3```
* A ```README.md``` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.7.*)
* All your files must be executable
* The length of your files will be tested using ```wc```

### Python Test Cases

* Allowed editors: ```vi```, ```vim```, ```emacs```
* All your files should end with a new line
* All your test files should be inside a folder ```tests```
* All your test files should be text files (extension: ```.txt```)
* All your tests should be executed by using this command: ```python3 -m doctest ./tests/*```
* All your modules should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'```)
* All your classes should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'```)
* All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'``` and ```python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'```)
* A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
* We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

### Documentation

* Do not use the words ```import``` or ```from``` inside your comments, the checker will think you are trying to import some modules
